# `ConsenSys Academy Bootcamp | 2021 Final Project`

## *Working Ideas*:
<br/>

### **1. Invoicing System**
Specifically, an invoicing system for businesses like Creative Agencies that deal with a mulitude of clients across a variety of industries and have a constant pipeline of contractual agreements. 
* A smart contract could help to alleviate weakpoints in the partnership and incentivize all parties to operate in good faith. 
* Using a blockchain to control invoicing can automate the process of creating an invoice, which usually happens after the fact, and instead stand as a live manifesto throughout the project's life. 
* Immediately upon delivery of the finished project, payment will be transferred.

### **2. Trustworthy Charity Donator**
In most recent times, GoFundMe has had its fair share of scandal when a fabricated plan manages to tug on the public's heartstrings and surpass the original set goal, only for it to be revealed as a sham. Likewise, there are many charities that do not have a strong online presence and are easy targets for the ill-intended to impersonate and divert donations. Utilizing blockchain technology can lift the veil on what can sometimes be a sketchy transaction by introducing transparency in tracking/seeing the journey of a donation and confirmed arrival of its intended destination.
* User allocates funds for donating
* Chooses charity they want to send money to
* Enters contract with said charity
* Both parties are notified of transaction and are able to track the donation's journey to its intended destination
